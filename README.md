# JNVconnect â€” Polished Morph UI
Files updated: index.html, home.html. This version focuses on a playful morphism UI with working Firebase-backed posts, events, and users. 
- Posts support image URLs, tags, create/edit/delete, real-time updates.
- Presence writes simple online status for current user.
- Theme toggle and playful background.

Deploy: upload all files to your static host. Ensure Realtime Database rules allow read/write for testing or set auth properly.
